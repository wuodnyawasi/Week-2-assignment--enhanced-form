	<h1>Understanding Semantics HTML5</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Semantics in HTML5 refers to the use of HTML tags that convey the meaning and structure of web content.</li>
    <li>Semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;section&gt; clearly define different parts of a web page, making the code more readable and accessible.</li>
    <li>Unlike non-semantic tags such as &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;, semantic tags provide context to both developers and assistive technologies like screen readers.</li>
    <li>Using semantic HTML improves SEO (Search Engine Optimization) by helping search engines better understand the content and its importance.</li>
    <li>HTML5 introduced many new semantic elements to encourage cleaner, more meaningful markup and enhance user experience across various devices.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Enhancing accessibility for all users</h3>
<article>
<p>Building websites with accessibility in mind is crucial because it ensures that everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with web content. This not only encompasses people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers or keyboard navigation, but also benefits users with temporary limitations (e.g., a broken arm) or situational constraints (e.g., bright sunlight). Prioritizing accessibility is not just a moral and ethical responsibility that promotes social inclusion, but also offers significant practical advantages, including expanding your audience reach, improving user experience for all, enhancing your website's SEO, and mitigating potential legal risks. Ultimately, an accessible website demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity, making the digital world a more equitable and functional space for everyone.</p>
